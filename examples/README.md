# Examples

## Getting started with examples

We will use Fastify just to run the examples. interval-emitter does not have a dependency on fastfy though.

- `git clone https://github.com/anthonyalbertyn/interval-emitter.git`
- `cd interval-emitter`
- `npm install fastify`
- `npm run example1` or `npm run example2`
- The examples will log output to the console
